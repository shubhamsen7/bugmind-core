# ðŸ§  BugMind Core

**BugMind Core** is the foundational module of an AI-assisted developer intelligence suite â€” a **Java-based engine** built for analyzing, parsing, and reasoning over application logs, designed under **SWE-Bench Private Repo** guidelines.

It showcases how feature and bug-fix workflows can be modeled for LLM-based software reasoning systems â€” with clear issue-PR linking, deterministic test coverage (P2P/F2P), and compliance with SWE-Bench Trainer Workflow V2.

## ðŸ§© Purpose

BugMind Core demonstrates **structured log analysis** â€” converting raw text logs into machine-readable formats that can later power higher-level AI components like anomaly detection, observability dashboards, and reasoning engines.

This repository forms the **core logic** layer for future BugMind modules:
- `bugmind-parser` (semantic extraction)
- `bugmind-ai` (LLM-driven diagnostics)
- `bugmind-dashboard` (visual log analytics)
- `bugmind-sim` (synthetic log simulation for testing)
